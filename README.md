ECN   410: Economics   of   Migration 
Spring 2025 
Course overview 
Migration is and has been an important phenomenon in the U.S.   and   throughout the   world.   This   course   will provide   students   with   an   overview   of   the   different   types   of   migration,   important   past   and   current   episodes   of migration, and policies dealing with migration. The course will   also   apply the tools   of   economics   to   understand several aspects of   migration including: its determinants,   its   effects   on   source   and   destination regions,   and the intended   and   unintended   consequences   of   migration   policy. 
We will begin by discussing international migration. We will discuss why people migrate to   other   countries, where they come from, and where they go,   and why they   go there.   We   will   also   study   how   migration   impacts   the places migrants leave and the places where they arrive. Understanding the research   documenting   these consequences will help us as we later evaluate past and current   immigration   policies   in   the   U.S.
We have   14 weeks to cover a great deal of   material.   It   is important   you   stay   on   top   of   the   readings, problem   sets, and quizzes. I also encourage students   to   take   advantage   of   my   office   hours   to   review   material.
Course objectives 
. Explain   basic   facts   about   important   past   and   current   episodes   of   migration
. Understand   methods   and   results   for   research   on   different   aspects   of   migration
. Evaluate   policies   dealing   with   migration
. Develop   analytical   writing   skills   through   the   format   of   policy   briefs
Background and prerequisites 
This course is primarily aimed at students   who   have   completed   the   intro   (ECN   101   and   102)   and   intermediate micro and macro sequences (ECN 301 and   ECN   302).   This   background   will   be   helpful   when   we   discuss   models   of   migrant selection and the labor market impacts of   migration.   Familiarity with   regression   analysis   will   also be useful as we delve into the empirical   strategies researchers   employ to   identify   causal   effects.   I want   to   stress that students will not be expected to fully understand the   methodological   details.   Instead, we   will   focus   on   understanding the basic intuition behind these strategies and how they may   (or may   not) provide   reliable estimates   of   the   causal   effects   of   some   policy, phenomena, or   intervention. 
Readings 
The required textbook for this course   is:
Cynthia Bansak, Nicole   Simpson, and Madeline Zavodny (2021). The Economics of Immigration, 2nd Edition This   textbook   is   available   online   through Syracuse University Libraries.There are also required articles (see tentative   dates   for those readings   in   the   course   outline   below).   All   these   articles have links or can be accessed through the Syracuse University Libraries website.   Generally,   you   can   access academic articles when connected to   SU’s Wi-Fi network. Please   let me know   if   you have   any   issue accessing these articles.
The schedule for the readings can be found in   the   course   calendar below.
It is strongly recommended that you read the readings each week before   class to have   some   familiarity   with   the   concepts to be discussed. Quizzes can cover topics covered   in   lecture   and   in   assigned readings.
Evaluation 
● Problem sets   (10%)
○       Four problems sets will be   assigned   and will   include   a   mixture   of   quantitative   problems,   short answer questions, and reading responses. The due dates   for these   four problem   sets   are   available   in the “ECN 410 Important Dates and Deadlines” document   on   Blackboard.
○       The problem sets   will be   posted   on   Blackboard   in   the   “Problem   Sets”   folder.   You   will upload   completed pro代 写ECN 410: Economics of Migration Spring 2025Python
代做程序编程语言blem sets to our course   Blackboard.
○       Homework is graded based   on   completeness.   I   encourage   you   to   work with   other   students   on your problem sets, but all explanations must be in your own words   and   fully   show   how   you   reached your answer. If   you turn in a problem set that   is   too   similar   to   another   student’s   work,   you will both receive zeros.
○         Grades are assigned on a scale   of   0 to   10.   Homework   submitted   after   the   deadline   will be considered late. Late submissions will incur a deduction   of   two points   for   every   24-hour period   following the deadline, with the minimum achievable   score set at   0.
● Quizzes (15%)
○       We will have 7   quizzes.   The   tentative   dates   for these   quizzes   are   available   in   the   “ECN   410   Important Dates and Deadlines” document on Blackboard.
○         Quizzes will take place during the first   15 minutes of   class   and will   cover material   from the previous lectures. These quizzes are not meant to be difficult   or   cause   you   any   significant   stress   but instead should serve to keep up with recent material.
○       Each quiz will be   worth   10 points.   I   will   drop   the   student’s   lowest   quiz   score   at   the   end   of   the   semester.
● Migration Policy Project (30%)
○       At the end   of   the   second week   of   class, you   and   a   small   group   of   students will   choose   a bilateral   migration channel (I can also assign   you   a   channel).   With this   group,   you   will be   responsible   for   writing   one   short   policy   brief   and   one   longer, more   polished   policy   brief   about   your   migration channel.
○       The first policy brief   will   address who   migrates,   why   they   migrate,   and   what   they   do   in   the destination country. It will also examine the effects   of   migration   on   the   migrant-origin   country   and/or the destination country. The first policy brief   is due Wednesday,   March   26th.
○       Each group will record   a   15-minute presentation   via   Zoom   which   educates   the   class   about   your   assigned migration channel, drawing on the findings   from your first policy brief.   Additionally,      you will   "pitch" a policy recommendation for either the migrant-origin country,   the   migrant-destination country, or both, addressing the key issues you have identified. You   are   to   upload            your group’s recording to Blackboard by April 9th. We will provide further instructions   on Blackboard. After the presentation, you will receive feedback from your peers, which can be   incorporated   into   your   final   policy   brief. 
○       Your final brief   will polish the   analysis   from your   first brief   and will   also   incorporate   your policy   recommendation. I will provide further details of   the assignment   and   a grading   rubric   on Blackboard. The final brief   is due Monday, April 21st.
● Midterm (20%)
○       The midterm is currently   scheduled   for   Thursday,   March   6th    during   class.
● Final (20%)
○         The final is currently scheduled for   Friday,   May   2nd   from   8:00   to   10:00am.   The   final   exam   date   and   time   is   scheduled   by   the registrar.
● Participation (5%)
○         Students that ask questions and participate actively in the   in-class   activities   throughout   the   term   will receive higher grades in this category.
○       Attendance will be taken throughout the   semester   and   will be   incorporated   into   your participation score. That being said, I do not   want   anyone to   come   to   class   if   they   are   not   feeling   well. Please reach out to the Barnes Center and   Student   Outreach   and   Support to have your absence excused.
